            <h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am Shubhang Srinivas Varda, currently navigating through the  terrain of a 1st-year B.Tech student's journey at RV University, specializing in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Beyond the academic realm, my enthusiasm finds expression in the vibrant world of Model United Nations, where I've secured victories in 8 out of the 12 conferences I've participated in. Elocution and debates also captivate me, offering a platform to articulate ideas and engage in compelling discussions. Despite a background in PCMB during my pre-university years, my passion for technology led me to choose Computer Science. I am driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, considering myself a quick learner perpetually seeking avenues for self-improvement. When not immersed in the world of code and discourse, I find solace in the rhythmic strokes of swimming and the adrenaline of a football match. As a quick learner and hard worker, I strive for excellence in all endeavors.
                On a lighter note, I'm also a foodie who loves trying new culinary delights!

            <h2><u>Achievements:</u></h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, I have actively pursued diverse interests and achieved notable milestones. My involvement in Model United Nations (MUN) stands out, having participated in 12 MUNs and securing victories in 8 of them. This experience not only honed my diplomatic and negotiation skills but also instilled in me an understanding of global issues. Complementing this, I have immersed myself in the world of aquatics, mastering all swimming strokes over the course of three years. This commitment to excellence extends to my engagement in public speaking events and elocutions, where I consistently strive to articulate ideas with conviction. These achievements collectively reflect my passion for multifaceted learning and my dedication to excelling in both academic and extracurricular pursuits.

                    <strong>Structured Innovation</strong>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this project, my team and I dived into the realm of entrepreneurship, engaging with various cases that prompted us to analyze and articulate our insights from an entrepreneurial perspective. As a culminating task, we were challenged to conceive and develop an innovative game. Opting for a distinctive approach, we conceptualized "Yoga Adventure" a captivating game designed to infuse the practice of yoga with an element of enjoyment and excitement. Our mission with this unique venture is to inspire individuals to engage in yoga through an entertaining and immersive experience.

                    <strong>Data Analysis with Python</strong>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I utilized Python for data analysis, exploring and deriving insights from datasets. Leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I performed various data manipulations, visualizations, and analyses to extract valuable information and patterns.The dataset I choose is Netflix.

                    <strong>DSCA Circuit (Fastest Finger First)</strong>
                    <p>In this project, our team undertook the exciting challenge of creating a circuit with a festive touch, specifically tailored for Diwali celebrations. The result? "Fastest Finger First," an engaging game featuring four push buttons and corresponding LEDs. The concept is simple yet thrilling: the participant who rapidly presses a push button will illuminate the associated LED, fostering a competitive and lively atmosphere. With the capability for up to three players to participate simultaneously, the game adds a dynamic and social element to the festivities. To reset the game and prepare for subsequent rounds, an additional push button is incorporated, resetting all buttons, LEDs, and activating a buzzer for a seamless and continuous gaming experience.</p>
